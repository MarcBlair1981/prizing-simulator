## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Calculations
- **Probability Model**: Poisson-binomial distribution
- **Independence Assumption**: Questions are independent events
- **Precision**: Float64 for probability calculations
- **Odds Format**: Decimal odds (e.g., 8.50 = 11.76% probability)

### Payout Modes Explained

#### Split Mode
- **Use Case**: Jackpot-style prizes with fixed pot
- **Cost Formula**: `Prize × P(at least one winner)`
- **Example**: $10,000 pot, 0.05% chance per user, 1000 users
  - P(≥1 winner) = 1 - (1 - 0.0005)^1000 ≈ 39.35%
  - Expected cost = $10,000 × 0.3935 = $3,935

#### Guaranteed Mode
- **Use Case**: Consolation prizes, guaranteed payouts
- **Cost Formula**: `Expected Winners × Prize`
- **Example**: $100 prize, 1.5% chance per user, 1000 users
  - Expected winners = 1000 × 0.015 = 15
  - Expected cost = 15 × $100 = $1,500

### Browser Compatibility
- **Recommended**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Required Features**: ES6+, SVG, LocalStorage (for future saves)
- **No Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Prize Structure Design
1. **Progressive Prizes**: Higher scores should have higher prizes
2. **Mode Selection**:
   - Use **Split** for top 1-3 scores (jackpots)
   - Use **Guaranteed** for consolation prizes (scores 0-3)
3. **Cost Management**: Monitor "Cost Per User" metric
4. **Balance**: Aim for 0.5-2% jackpot probability for engagement

### Odds Configuration
1. **Consistency**: Use similar odds across questions for predictable distribution
2. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Easy: 1.50-2.50 (40-67% probability)
   - Medium: 3.00-5.00 (20-33% probability)
   - Hard: 6.00-10.00 (10-17% probability)
   - Very Hard: 10.00+ (<10% probability)
3. **Testing**: Use "Preview" to test before applying

### Cost Optimization
1. **Start with Presets**: Use proven prize structures
2. **Adjust Gradually**: Make small changes and observe impact
3. **Monitor Totals**: Keep eye on "Total Expected Prize"
4. **Use Split Wisely**: Split mode reduces cost for high-value prizes
5. **Participant Scaling**: Test with different participant counts

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Prizes don't appear in table**  
A: Ensure you've entered values in the Prize column and clicked outside the input

**Q: Expected cost seems wrong**  
A: Check payout mode - Split vs Guaranteed have very different cost models

**Q: Can't load CSV**  
A: Ensure CSV format: `Question,Odds,Answer` with header row

**Q: Preset doesn't apply**  
A: Uncheck "Apply structure" to keep current questions, only apply prizes

**Q: Chart not showing**  
A: Add at least one question with valid odds (≥1.01)
